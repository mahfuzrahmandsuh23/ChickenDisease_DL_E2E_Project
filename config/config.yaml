# In the context of end-to-end deep learning projects, 
# "artifacts" refer to the various outputs and components generated 
# throughout the project lifecycle.
#  These can include data sets, preprocessed data,
#   model files (e.g., weights, architecture), training scripts,
#    environment configuration files (for reproducibility), 
#    logs, and any other files that are produced 
#    or used by the machine learning models.
#     Artifacts are crucial for understanding the project's 
#     evolution, ensuring reproducibility, and facilitating 
# model deployment and monitoring in production environments.
